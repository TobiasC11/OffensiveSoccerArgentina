## 📌 Introduction

This analysis explores the characteristics of offensive teams in Argentina's Professional League between 2021 and 2024. Using a custom-designed Offensive Index, we compare their statistics with non-offensive teams to assess whether their style translates into better overall performance.

## ⚙️ Methodology

### What Is an Offensive Team?

For this study, we created an **Offensive Index** based on **min-max normalization** of various offensive metrics. The index places more weight on **chance creation** (xG, touches in the box, big chances) than on finishing (goals), aiming to capture attacking style, not just scoring efficiency.

Teams were classified as *"offensive"* if their index score was above the 65th percentile for their respective season.

## 🧠 Reflections and Limitations

Data was gathered from various public sources using scraping techniques (FBref, Fotmob, etc.), with notable limitations for South American leagues. This restricted the depth of some parts of the analysis.

**Limitations**:
- Seasonal inconsistencies or missing data
- Lack of play-by-play event data
- No control for factors like home advantage, opponent quality, or tactics

### Next Steps:
We are developing a model to analyze how forward performance varies when transferring from a non-offensive to an offensive team, which is not included in this report.
